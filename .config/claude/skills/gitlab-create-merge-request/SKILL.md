# Create Merge Request

Create a GitLab merge request for the current branch targeting `main`.

## Steps

1. Get the first commit message of the current branch (compared to main):

   ```bash
   git log main..HEAD --reverse --format="%s" | head -n 1
   ```

2. Create the MR using glab:
   ```bash
   glab mr create -t "<FIRST_COMMIT_MESSAGE>" -d "<SUMMARY_OF_WHAT_HAS_BEEN_DONE>" -b main --fill -y
   ```

## Notes

- Ensure the branch has been pushed before running this command
- The MR title will be the first commit message of the branch
